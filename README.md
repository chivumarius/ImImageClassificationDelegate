  <h5 style="color:blue;">&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>IMAGE CLASSIFICATION</b> </h5>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; A common use of machine learning is to identify what an image represents.
  For example, we might want to know what type of animal appears in a photograph.

  &nbsp; &nbsp; The task of predicting what an image represents is called "Image Classification".
  An "Image Classification Model" is trained to recognize various classes of images.
  For example, a model might be trained to recognize photos representing three different types of animals: rabbits, cats and dogs

  <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>TENSORFLOW LITE DELEGATE</b></h5>

   &nbsp; &nbsp; By default "Tensorflow Lite" use "CPU Kernels", which is not Optimized for "Heavy Arithmetic Operations" found in "Machine Learning Models" ("Neural Network").

  &nbsp; &nbsp; That's why we use" Delegate", which enables "Hardware Acceleration" of "Tenserflo Lite Models" using "Accelerators" such as "GPU" and "DSP" ("Digital Signal Processor").
